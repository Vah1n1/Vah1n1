## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ”­I'm developing a data analysis program for astronomical data. This program will help me find patterns and commonalities in large data sets, which would otherwise be time-consuming.
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about space, physics and programming. 
ðŸŒ±Feel free to offer any advice. It will be well appreciated!
